The image-list call to the Images v2 API now recognizes a protected
query-string parameter.  This parameter accepts only two values: either
true or false.  The filter is case-sensitive.  Any other value
will result in a 400 response to the request.  See the protected filter
specification document for details.

A new policy, tasks_api_access has been introduced so that ordinary
user credentials may be used by Glance to manage the tasks that accomplish
the interoperable image import process without requiring that operators
expose the Tasks API to end users.

Glance is now packaged with a WSGI script entrypoint, enabling it to be
run as a WSGI application hosted by a performant web server.  See Running
Glance in HTTPD
in the Glance documentation for details.
There are some limitations with this method of deploying Glance and we
do not recommend its use in production environments at this time.  See
the Known Issues section of this document for more information.
