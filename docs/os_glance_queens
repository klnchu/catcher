A new interoperable image import method, web-download is
introduced.  This method allows an end user to import an image from
a remote URL.  The image data is retrieved from the URL and stored
in the Glance backend.  (In other words, this is a copy-from
operation.)
This feature is enabled by default, but it is optional.  Whether
it is offered at your installation depends on the value of the
enabled_import_methods configuration option in the glance-api.conf
file (assuming, of course, that you have not disabled image import at
your site).


Added a plugin to inject image metadata properties to non-admin
images created via the interoperable image import process.

Added a new command glance-manage db check, the command will
allow a user to check the status of upgrades in the database.
