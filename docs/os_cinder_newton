dell_server_os option added to the Dell SC driver. This option allows the selection of the server type used when creating a server on the Dell DSM during initialize connection. This is only used if the server does not exist. Valid values are from the Dell DSM create server list.

Added support for the use of live volume in place of standard replication in the Dell SC driver.

Added volume driver for Zadara Storage VPSA.

Added a new config option scheduler_weight_handler. This is a global option which specifies how the scheduler should choose from a listed of weighted pools. By default the existing weigher is used which always chooses the highest weight.

Added a new weight handler StochasticHostWeightHandler. This weight handler chooses pools randomly, where the random probabilities are proportional to the weights, so higher weighted pools are chosen more frequently, but not all the time. This weight handler spreads new shares across available pools more fairly.

Allow API user to remove the consistency group name or description information.

Support for snapshot backup using the optimal path in Huawei driver.

Added REST API to update backup name and description.

Report pools in volume stats for Block Device Driver.

HA A-A: Add cluster configuration option to allow grouping hosts that share the same backend configurations and should work in Active-Active fashion.

HA A-A: Updated manage command to display cluster information on service listings.

HA A-A: Added cluster subcommand in manage command to list, remove, and rename clusters.

HA A-A: Added clusters API endpoints for cluster related operations (index, detail, show, enable/disable).  Index and detail accept filtering by name, binary, disabled, num_hosts, num_down_hosts, and up/down status (is_up) as URL parameters.  Also added their respective policies.

The xiv_ds8k driver now supports IBM XIV, Spectrum Accelerate, FlashSystem A9000, FlashSystem A9000R and DS8000 storage systems, and was renamed to IBM Storage Driver for OpenStack. The changes include text changes, file names, names of cinder.conf flags, and names of the proxy classes.

Support for retype volumes with different encryptions including changes from unencrypted types to encrypted types and vice-versa.

Added support for manage/unmanage snapshot in the ScaleIO driver.

Added support for scaling QoS in the ScaleIO driver. The new QoS keys are maxIOPSperGB and maxBWSperGB.
