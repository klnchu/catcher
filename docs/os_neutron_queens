Ports have now a dns_domain attribute. A port’s dns_domain attribute has precedence over the network’s dns_domain from the point of view of publishing it to the external DNS service.

The DSCP value for outer headers in openvswitch overlay tunnel ports can now be set through a configuration option dscp for both OVS and linuxbridge agents.

DSCP can also be inherited from the inner header through a new boolean configuration option dscp_inherit for both openvswitch and linuxbridge. If this option is set to true, then the value of dscp will be ignored.

Allow configuration of DHCP renewal (T1) and rebinding (T2) timers in
neutron-dhcp-agent. By allowing these timers to be set (options 58
and 59 as per RFC2132) in dnsmasq it allows users to change
other parameters, like MTU, on instances without having to wait for
the lease time to expire. The advantage of changing T1 over the
lease time is that if the DHCP server becomes unreachable within
the lease time, instances will not drop their IP addresses and it
will not cause a dataplane disruption.

Tenants who can access shared networks, can now create/update
ports on a specified subnet instead of the default subnet.
This is now the default behavior and can be changed by modifying
policy.json file.

It is now possible to instruct the DHCP agent not to supply any DNS server
address to their clients by setting the dns_nameservers attribute for
the corresponding subnet to 0.0.0.0 or ::, for IPv4 or IPv6 subnets
(respectively).

L2 agents based on ML2 _common_agent have now the L2 extension API
available. This API can be used by L2 extension drivers to request
resources from the L2 agent.
It is used, for example, to pass an instance of the IptablesManager
to the Linuxbridge L2 agent QoS extension driver.

A new DVR agent type dvr_no_external has been introduced with this
release. This agent type allows the Floating IPs (DNAT/North-South routing)
to be centralized while the East/West routing is still distributed.

Implementation of floating IP QoS. A new parameter qos_policy_id was added to floating IP related API.

Neutron agents now support SSL connections to OVSDB server.
To enable an SSL based connection, use an ssl prefixed URI for the
ovsdb_connection setting.  When using SSL it is also required to set
new ovs group options which include ssl_key_file, ssl_cert_file, and
ssl_ca_cert_file.

Support substring matching when filtering ports by IP address.

A new method get_router_info has been added to L3AgentExtensionAPI.

A new method ha_state_change has been added to
L3AgentExtensionsManager.
